# SalesforceOrgBackUp

This repo contains the node.js script for retrieving the entire metadata(supported by Metadata API)  from Salesforce org ( the org should be configured/Authorized in SFDX already). 

<b>Sample usecase: </b> <br/>
This can be helpful for taking backup of entire ORG. 
One Sample Use Case will be taking ORG backup during sandbox refresh process so that we do not lose any data accidentally.

<b> This is testing . please ignore </b> 

<b> Technical Design </b> <br/>
The code works completely based on the native sfdx commands integrated with node.js via Shelljs(npm module).
